# xrGUI
Minimalist toolkit for Win32 native GUIs

xrGUI is a header only, minimalist set of classes for native win32 GUI development. It provides a simple set of functionality for developing simple GUIs in C++. Only a basic set of controls and features are supported.

The entire project is contained within GUI.hpp and within the xrGUI namespace.

See the example project for an example of use, including creating a window with controls, setting styles and properties, and defining callback functions.
